This is what this year group learns, this is what micromusic teaches. Match to curriculum. One method
Mention exam boards that fit your rhetoric


Interview Users. One plays instrument, one doesn't.
Can they use it. How far could they get by just having it. Would I have to explain. Record interview/video of them doing it for the first time.
Ask them to talk out loud. What is the weird thing, what did they expect it to do.

Experience before hand. have you heard of them/used them. What's your experience with music. Outside/inside school. Do they enjoy music. vs do
they enjoy this. would they like to use this again.
What's wrong with it

Navigation, screen size, ease of use.
Open ended questions. If bad answers, did you like the menu, creating music etc.

Good some minutes to play, sit away and let them figure it out.


Interview some adults about the user interface. Opinions on font and stuff.

What were you aiming to build vs what you actually built. Was aiming to this and didn't is fine.

This memory wasn't enough or whatever.

Too complicated for someone if that was the case. Or too simple.

Keep them aware.
Clarify no personal questions. Nothing that could upset them like why they don't like or anything to shame them


Could give them some certain scenarios to test after they've familiarised with the program a little bit.

Ask the children for future work. What would they like to see in this in the future. Do you think your music teacher would like this?

Usability, funness, features I wanna test. Is it too heavy too light too small. What needs changing.

List of features I want to ask about so I can tick them off during the interview.
