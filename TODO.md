### TODO

## Bugs

-   [x] Crash when clicking on setting inside of setting button

## General

-   [x] Split grid into note sections
-   [x] Grid current note highlighting instead of constant scrolling
-   [ ] Sample selection screen
-   [x] BPM calculation for tick speed
-   [ ] Moving over and selecting last 2 samples
-   [x] Way to go through the sounds
-   [ ] Keyboard screen
-   [x] IMPORTANT - Reloading a screen with state, need to get back or store the state somehow
-   [ ] Octave stuff - Semitones done, for octaves it owuld be just halving or doubling
-   [ ] Need to sort sample selection
-   [ ] Minimising the number of clicks - find commonalities
-   [ ] Music that repeats notes, select multiple notes at once?
-   [ ] Copy paste stuff
-   [ ] Anything that would make note entry easier
-   [x] Navigate D-Pad to go down and then new page, up and down to increment through scale
-   [x] Kind of like select a row, using the cursor, select with a button, then up and down buttons could change the pitch of the note being played
-   [x] Could play the note as you select it

## Note Scrolling

-   [ ] Any adjustments needed for the visual effect, such as when it shows/when it doesn't
-   [x] Make padding visible, add some indicator as to how far down the song it is currently and have it then sit in the middle while it continues to scroll down
-   [x] Add indicator to when the song is playing instead of just note selection. As part of this, limit the cursor to the control buttons whilst it is playing.
-   [x] Implement the scrolling to the note selection
-   [x] Flesh out note selection with highlighting and making it actually change the notes that you want it to
-   [x] Add smooth scrolling via ticks seen in microdata

## Settings

-   [x] Settings screen (Made but need to make more assets and pick settings)
-   [x] Settings functionality - BPM

## Assets

## Other

-   [ ] Play stops using other buttons
-   [ ] Musical notation
-   [ ] 128-block length, can extend songs with different blocks/repeat blocks
-   [ ] Continuing on - multiple screens of data, song structure view and defining samples
